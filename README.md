## About

A small package aimed at the beauty of the code in your project, which contains the most primitive but useful universal macros that you can easily modify to suit your project.  
These macros will allow you to avoid cluttering your project with utilitarian functions and extensions that could not be expressed as a generic function or if the function call is very cumbersome.  
Primitive, reliable, excellent :)

It's important to understand that swift macros have annoying limitations that prevent you from inserting any code anywhere. More precisely, you can insert it, but it wonâ€™t work. Thus, it is not possible to create a mass of truly useful macros.
I created this package with a lot of ideas, but most of them were broken by the modest macro capabilities in the process of working on it.
  I sincerely hope that the developers will come to their senses and expand the capabilities of macros in the future.
Then you and I will definitely have fun :)
