# UCgorgeous v1.00 - alpha

## About

A small package aimed at the beauty of the code in your project, which contains the most primitive but useful universal macros that you can easily modify to suit your project.  
These macros will allow you to avoid cluttering your project with utilitarian functions and extensions that could not be expressed as a generic function or if the function call is very cumbersome.  
Primitive, reliable, excellent :)

## Comes with

Valid tests.  
Description of the purpose of the function with an example of use.
